You can change the country you want to see the price of by changing the language const to the country of your choice.

You can easily see the language when you go the site and look at the url, the part after www.ikea.com/ will be the language
split by a '/' for example www.ikea.com/se/sv/

You can also have the prices converted to other currencies by changing these variables:
  - const language = "nl/nl";     // Input the country code of the website you wish to compare to in this format '../..'
  - const baseCurrency = "EUR";   // The base currency used in the country you are comparing to, (the one you put in above ^^ )
  - const otherCurrency = "EUR";  // The currency you want that article's price to be shown in (the currency you use)
